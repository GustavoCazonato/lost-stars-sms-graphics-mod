# lost-stars-sms-graphics-mod
This is a graphical mod of Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars, for the Sega Master System.
Alex's sprites were replaced with new ones. He looks less like a baby and more like Alex Kidd himself.
The level palettes were also changed. Not intended to be closer to the Arcade version, but rather, something appealing to the eyes.
Alex's infamous scream was also removed. It caused the removal of the "Find the Miracle Ball" voice.
Due to my lack of knowledge about compressed graphics, I couldn't replace some enemies as I wanted to. For example, that infamous guy in the third level.
